# calliope
Hello! Calliope is just a coding project that has been on my mind for a while, probably will haunt me for a while longer. Every now and then I come back to it, don't expect anything of me though im scared of comitment ;-;.

Basically Calliope is a 'digital assistant', the specifics of which change almost everytime I come back to it. She's been used for giving out daily bible verses, pomodoro timers, and even just a chatgpt api; The hope is that someday the stars will align, and she'll become a great assistant in life ^^
